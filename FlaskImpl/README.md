# "Pretend" Flask

This directory contains a "pretend" implementation of Flask. The idea is to show one 
way Flask _might_ be implemented so that the framework doesn't feel like "magic".
Flask is open source, so you can just go to GitHub and 
[look at the actual source yourself](https://github.com/pallets/flask); however, 
because Flask has so many features, it can be difficult to see at a glance what is
actually going on.
